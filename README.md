- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - A JavaScript library for creating and displaying animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL.
- [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) - A free, open-source project that provides web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication (RTC) via simple application programming interfaces (APIs).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
